          Hi my name is Jack Dachtler. I am new to the industry and have been
          privately tutored to reach the level of Junior developer. In this
          section I will talk about what programs I have used and what my goal
          is once all is complete.
        </p>
        <h3>What I've used</h3>
        <h4>Github</h4>
        <p>
          As i live near London and my tutor lives some distance away, the first
          area I had to learn was Github. This was so we could set up a
          repository for him to set me goals and targets on building different
          applications in a variety of different ways. I was astounded at the
          amount of versitlity Github has and just how much can be done with it
          (I am sure all devlopers have no doubt this).
        </p>
        <h4>Web Trifecta</h4>
        <p>
          Around the same time we worked on increasing my knowledge on the Web
          trifecta (HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript) as this is the basis of almost
          all front-end web development. This is when we started to build our
          first application of Noughts & Crosses (this website contains a more
          advanced version of my original attempt).
        </p>
        <h4>Bootstrap 4</h4>
        <p>
          After we had picked our way through the rather steep beginners
          learning curve of Github and the trifecta we moved on to learning how
          to use Bootstrap 4. From here my tutor talked me through how Bootstrap
          is just another way of writing CSS and HTML created by the developers
          at Twitter. I instantly noticed how much more intuitive and
          streamlined it all is and instantly took a liking to it. Using
          Bootstrap we then started work on creating the Calculator which you
          can see on this website and Sudoku. These projects helped me to
          reafirm my knowledge of javascript.
