    For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!
    In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and
    the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his
    girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns.
    Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

    You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Tell
    her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Why would a robot need to drink?
  </p>
  <p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
    We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye,
    cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute
    little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may beâ€¦
  </p>

  <p>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
    We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
    Why yes! Thanks for noticing.
